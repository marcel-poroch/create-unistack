# create-unistack

A simple tool that helps you quickly create full-stack projects without the hassle of manual setup.

## What does it do?

Run a command, choose a template (React, Next.js, or Node.js), optionally add Zustand for state management or TailwindCSS for styling, and you're done! You get a new project configured and ready to go.

## How to use it?

```bash
npx create-unistack
```

Or if you want to specify the project name directly:

```bash
npx create-unistack my-awesome-app
```

The tool will guide you step by step through the process, and at the end you'll have a working project you can start coding right away.

## What templates are available?

- **React + Vite** (TypeScript or JavaScript)
- **Next.js** (TypeScript)
- **Node.js + Express**

For React projects, you can choose to add:
- **Zustand** for state management
- **TailwindCSS** for styling

Everything is configured automatically, no headaches.
